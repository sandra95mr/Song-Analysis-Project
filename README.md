#  Song-Analysis-Project

Final Project Developed in Class with Python

# Description 🎵

This project, developed as the final assignment for my Certificate of Higher Education in Multiplatform Application Development, aimed to create a neural network trained to detect specific themes in reggaeton-trap songs using an Excel dataset. Additionally, the project includes a program for descriptive and exploratory analysis, generating graphs and visualizations (Python and related libraries for training and data analysis).

# Features 🧬📊

- Neural Network: Developed a neural network for detecting themes in reggaeton-trap songs.
- Binary Data Matrix: Manually created a binary matrix indicating the presence or absence of themes in songs, as the network did not achieve minimum reliability due to the limited amount of data
- Descriptive Analysis: Implemented a program for descriptive and exploratory analysis of song themes through a binary data matrix.

# Inspiration 💭

This project is inspired by the passion for music, as well as my background in sociology, data analysis, and programming. I wanted to combine all these elements to draw conclusions about the possible influence of reggaeton and trap songs on teenagers. With the neural network, statistical analysis, and research on the influence of music on individuals, I aimed to derive insights.
